Level 2
=======

-  Solution is kept as in a way that most accurately describes the architecture of the system. This means that top level decomposition consists of:
    - Application
        - Interfaces
        - Delivery
        - REST
    - Core
    - Infrastructure
    - Boundary
    - Data

Ideally we want to keep Core and business logic inside it as separate from implementation contained in infrastructure.
