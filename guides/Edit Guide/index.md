## Getting Started
This guide describes a way to edit files in your documentation placed on git repository from the window of browser by using a Confluence plugin.

While using Git4C as a browser for files placed inside GIT repository there is a need to edit files directly in browser window, without need to use external tool for this. 

Such a requirement as editing files is placed in a Git4C Plugin and called as Git4C Editor.
